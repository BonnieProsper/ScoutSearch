## Datasets

Raw datasets are intentionally not tracked in version control.

To reproduce benchmarks:
1. Download the ABC News dataset from Kaggle.
2. Place files under `datasets/abc_news/`
3. Run `scripts/prepare_abc_news.py`

Small sample files are available under `examples/` for demos and tests.
